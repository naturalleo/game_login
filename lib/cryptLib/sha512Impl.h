/*** Implementation Notes (Caveats):
	* This was a quick implementation that took about a day and a half of coding. It is incorrect in
	that it is limited to strings of maximum length 2^32 instead of 2^128 as the algorithm states. This
	is mainly due to using std::string as the source string which is limited to 2^32 characters in length.
	* I began implementing this with a mind to make it flexible towards implementing the 256-bit and
	384 bit versions of the SHA-2 family of algorithms, but this would need a thorough code refactoring
	overhaul to ensure that goal. The flexibility begins and ends with the line "#define w_bits 64"
	* Efficiency and speed can now be (re)worked into this code now that correctness has been reasonably
	established (save the first caveat above). One suggestion is to convert the common operations 
	(functions) to macros (i.e., ROTR(),Ch(),Maj(),etc.). Another is to remove the SHR() function since
	I added this simply for functional equivalence to the SHA specification. I'll leave it to the 
	efficiency experts to tweak this.
	* I chose not to do anything at the step "Step 2: Parse the message", since this was equivalent to
	preprocessing the entire message, which could become unwieldy for larger messages. Instead I created
	the function "PackMessageBlock()" to "preprocess" in-place. Other refactoring options should be
	considered, especially when addressing the first caveat above.
	* I judged the correctness of my implementation by performing the tests "Single Block Message" and
	"Multi-Block Message" as listed in PDF referenced above.
	* Ideally, the core functionality of the algorithm should be converted into a library (or
	incorporated into an existing library, such as ncFoundation or arda2).
	* The LoadK() function exists (and other similar anamolies) due to the fact that I don't know how
	(if there exists a way) to create 64-bit constants (integers) in C/C++. I resolved this throughout
	the code by static_cast'ing a 32-bit constant, bit-shifting the 64-bit temporary left 32 bits, then
	adding the 64-bit temporary to the lower 32-bit constant, also 64-bit static_cast'ed. Lame, but it
	gets the job done.
	* This implementation assumes that a "message" is composed of whole bytes. Thus, in the padding step
	we assume that we can pad the whole byte "0xA0", instead of just the bit "1", as the SHA document
	states. This should be changed for maximum compliance, and to allow this to be used in a wider
	range of applications.
	* For correctness testing I also downloaded the SHA library "QuickHash" from 
	http://www.slavasoft.com/quickhash/index.htm and wrote the following win32 console app:

	/////////////
	#include <cstdlib>
	#include <cstdio>
	#include <string>
	#include "QuickHash.h"

	using namespace QuickHash;
	using namespace std;

	int main (int argc, char* argv[])
	{
	if (argc > 1)
	{
	string msg = argv[1];
	for (int i = 2; i < argc; ++i)
	{
	msg += " ";
	msg += argv[i];
	}

	char dest[CSHA512::HEXDIGESTSIZE];
	CSHA512::CalculateHex(dest,msg.c_str());

	printf("digest: %s\n",dest);
	}

	system("pause");
	return 0;
	}
	/////////////

*** 64-bit notes
	printf format specifier: use %I64d for signed integer output and %I64X for hex output.
	data type: use __int64 (WIN32 only) or unsigned long long for ANSI portability (compiler dependent).
	operations:
	AND: &
	OR: |
	XOR: ^
	Bitwise complement: ~
	addition: +
	left-shift: <<
	right-shift: >>
